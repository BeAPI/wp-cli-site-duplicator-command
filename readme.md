# WP-CLI Site Duplicator

For multisite only. Introduces a WP-CLI command for duplicating a site on a WordPress multisite network.

Install and activate as a normal plugin. Then in the command line, from your site's root directory, run `wp help`. You should see `duplicate` as a registered command, then you can continue.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6

## Installation

wp plugin install https://github.com/BeAPI/wp-cli-site-duplicator-command/archive/refs/heads/master.zip --activate-network
```

## Usage

```

Duplicate a specific site on the network:

```
wp site duplicate <new-site-slug> --url=domain.tld/somesite
```
